# AutoWand
AutoWand is a proof-of-concept of an application that enables auto repair shops to store and retrieve customer information, add and remove services to a customer's cart, and generate an invoice for the service.

It is written in C# and XAML, using WPF to create a robust GUI application.

This project was made to familiarize myself with View Models, User Controls, accessing databases using LINQ statements, and using bindings to link the databases to GUI.
